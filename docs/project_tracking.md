- Secure API key storage and usage

## Tasks Completed âœ…

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning
- [x] Read and understand Politics and War API reference
- [x] Create documentation folder structure
- [x] Initialize project tracking document
- [x] Create comprehensive task list
- [x] Analyze project requirements and create system architecture plan
- [x] Create initial project structure and package.json files
- [x] Set up database schema with Prisma ORM
- [x] Set up Discord OAuth integration for user authentication

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Management
- [x] Discord OAuth configuration with Passport.js
- [x] JWT token management and session handling
- [x] Authentication middleware and route protection
- [x] User profile management and preferences
- [x] Basic frontend with React/TypeScript and Material-UI

## Tasks In Progress ðŸ”„

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Management
- [ ] Create API key management system for Politics and War accounts

## Tasks To Do ðŸ“‹

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Management
- [ ] Set up Discord OAuth integration for user authentication
- [ ] Create API key management system for Politics and War accounts
- [ ] Create database schema for users, alliances, and API keys
- [ ] Implement security measures for API key storage and access

### Phase 3: Core Application Structure
- [ ] Implement alliance-specific routing system (/AllianceName/ModuleName)
- [ ] Build central administration panel for assigning alliance managers
- [ ] Develop alliance manager dashboard with API key linking

### Phase 4: API Integration
- [ ] Integrate Politics and War GraphQL API for data fetching
- [ ] Implement API rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Create alliance data synchronization system

### Phase 5: Alliance Management Features
- [ ] Build alliance member management interface
- [ ] Create alliance banking dashboard
- [ ] Implement war tracking and notifications
- [ ] Add trade and market analysis tools

### Phase 6: Security & Administration
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add audit logging for API usage
- [ ] Create backup and recovery systems
- [ ] Security testing and penetration testing

### Phase 7: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit testing for all components
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Production deployment setup

## Key Decisions Made

1. **API Choice**: Using Politics and War GraphQL API v3 for all data operations
2. **Authentication**: Discord OAuth for user authentication (leverages existing game community)
3. **Architecture**: Alliance-specific routing with centralized user management

## Technical Notes

### Politics and War API Key Points
- Standard users: 2,000 requests/day
- VIP users: 15,000 requests/day
- API endpoint: `https://api.politicsandwar.com/graphql`
- Authentication via `?api_key=` parameter
- GraphQL queries with comprehensive filtering

### Security Considerations
- API keys must be encrypted at rest
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit all API key usage
- Secure Discord OAuth flow
